# Welcome to SMART BOARD :)

In this project, the initial idea is to create a circuit board that monitors the air temperature inside a computer and displays it on a screen.

There are a wide variety of products on the market that, adapted, can meet the proposed demand. However these products are too expensive and too simple for commercial applications or more elaborate projects. In this project we want to create a single circuit board that has controllers, sensor inputs and a built-in screen, without using ready-made solutions.

Thank you for your visit and your contribution :D
